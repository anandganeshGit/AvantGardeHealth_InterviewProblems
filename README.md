Hi,
The Index1.html and Index2.html are the html pages for Question 1 and 2.

1) The index1.html will have two fields which will get input from user and display the output in the other field (the next greatest integer). Run the Index1.html to execute the Question1.

2) The index2.html will have getImages button that will import the images from the link and will display only one at a time. The Next and Prev buttons are to navigate to other images. Run the Index2.html to execute the Question2.
